After a vite project has been initialized and the example code deleted, these prompts have been executed: 

# setup

set up a canvas in index.html
In main.ts, onload (or immedeately if window is loaded), create a new Loop
instance from loop.ts

loop.ts gets the canvas element as a parameter and initilizes webgl2

main calls loop.start

loop.start registers for resize events, calls internal resize function
initially and then calls internal loop() wich calls itself with
requestAnimFrame

keep the style in the .css file.
